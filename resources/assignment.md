Thank you for your interest in the [Curriculum Developer](https://www.codecademy.com/about/jobs/curriculum-developer) role.

We ask that candidates submit a written assignment as part of their interview process. This assignment simulates a task that you'll have as a Curriculum Developer.

1. Review this [Binding and Iteration outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18C0BIl5qrZuysecCqYlxAanD9SfrWjOlStYIPK2Q5CE/edit). Design outlines are provided to Curriculum Developers by the Curriculum Designer. They provide the scope and depth of the concepts to be taught and are organized by learning standards. It is the job of a Curriculum Developer to turn the outline into an engaging lesson. The outline provides boundaries for the lessons and Curriculum Developers should be creative within those boundaries. The outline is not meant to be applied word-for-word in the lesson. Curriculum Developers should teach the standard in their own unique and creative way.
2. Select **one** learning standard from the document.
3. Write **at least one exercise** for the selected learning standard. The number of exercises you write is for you to decide. Regardless of the number of exercises, make sure your lesson covers the learning standard in its entirety. Your exercise(s) should include narrative and exercise steps with code.

For context, review this [exercise on JavaScript data types](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-javascript/lessons/introduction-to-javascript/exercises/types). Each exercise is a part of a lesson, and each lesson is a part of a course. Review our [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) to become familiar with our course structure. Familiarity with our course structure may help you scope your exercises appropriately.

## Submitting

**Please submit your answers within 72 hours.** We will evaluate your assignment on technical accuracy, structure, delivery, clarity, tone, and overall editorial quality. We encourage you to consider these criteria for success and take creative risks with your lesson.

We use Git, text files, and [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) extensively during the content creation process and our written application follows the same process.

Following the gitflow workflow, you should create a feature branch that includes your answers. This is a private repository. Your submission will not be shared with anyone else.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Check out a feature branch with your name (e.g. `git checkout -b sonny`).
3. Create a new **Markdown file** (.md file extension) in this repository for **each exercise** you write.
4. Use proper [Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
5. Commit your changes.
6. Push your feature branch to this repository on GitHub.
7. Open a pull request to merge your feature branch into master, and assign `mikesjewett` as the reviewer.

We assess this writing assignment very carefully. We expect you to follow the instructions, write thoughtfully, and take creative risks with your submission. Approach this assignment as if you are writing content that will be available to our millions of passionate learners.

We will reply within five business days of your submittal. Thanks, and good luck!
